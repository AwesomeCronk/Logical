# Logical

This program is a logic gate simulator for Windows. It supports all the basic gates and the ability to create sub-circuits. Some ideas I hope to implement eventually are multi-core processing and network multi-machine processing.

## Getting Started
The best way to get started is by reading through the docs. They are written in a way that is half documentation, half crash course. It is best to start with the page on syntax.

## To Do
* ~~Fix tristates and busses~~
* ~~Improve/fix includes~~
* ~~Automatic circuit updates~~
* ~~Documentation~~ Started - needs more actual language work done to continue.
* ~~Improve the UI~~ Started - needs some controls and more outputs.
* Multiprocessing
* Multi-PC processing via sockets?
* Actual command line args with `argparse`
* Error logging with `logging`

## Release Notes
* 0.1.0 - Added version tracking
* 0.2.0 - Fixed includes
* 0.3.0 - Reworked syntax, started documentation, started the UI overhaul
