### Logical

This program is a logic gate simulator for Windows. It supports all the basic gates and the ability to create sub-circuits. Some ideas I hope to implement eventually are multi-core processing and network multi-machine processing.

## To Do:
* ~~Fix tristates and busses~~
* ~~Improve/fix includes~~~
* Automatic circuit updates
* Documentation
* Improve the UI
* Multiprocessing
* Multi-PC processing via sockets?
